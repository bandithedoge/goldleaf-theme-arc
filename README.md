A port of the [Arc GTK theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) and [Arc icon theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-icon-theme) for [Goldleaf](https://github.com/XorTroll/Goldleaf).

## Installation:
* Download the latest [release](https://github.com/bandithedoge/goldleaf-theme-arc/releases) (pick whatever version you prefer)
* Extract the zip file to your SD card's root

**NOTE: This theme will probably be broken once Goldleaf 0.6 is released. I'll update it when it happens.**
